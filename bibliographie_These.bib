The vehicles face traffic congestion which, at peak periods, significantly restricts vehicle speeds and leads to increased emissions. Our algorithm is based on an adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic and uses new removal and insertion operators which significantly improve the quality of the solution. A previously developed departure time and speed optimization procedure is used as a subroutine to optimize departure times and vehicle speeds. Results from extensive computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm."

In this paper, the GVRSP considers heterogeneous vehicles, time-varying traffic congestion, capacity constraints and the delivery can be fractionated. The GVRSP also allows vehicles to stop on arcs, so vehicle is allowed to travel an arc in multiple time periods. We present a mathematical formulation to describe the problem and a hybrid algorithm that combines the metaheuristic Iterated Local Search (ILS), the Random Variable Neighborhood Descent (RVND) procedure and an exact Set Covering model. The results obtained are compared with the state of the art and we show that the proposed approach has a strong performance."

	abstract="In many industrialized countries, manufacturing industries pay stratified electricity charges depending on the time of day (i.e., peak-load, mid-load, and off-peak-load). In contrast, the emerging smart grid concept may demand that industries pay real-time hourly electricity costs so as to use energy most efficiently. This paper deals with the production and energy efficiency of the unrelated parallel machine scheduling problem. This method allows the decision maker to seek a compromise solution using the weighted sum objective of production scheduling and electricity usage. Reliability models are used to consider the energy cost aspect of the problem. This paper aims to optimize the weighted sum of two criteria: the minimization of the makespan of production and the minimization of time-dependent electricity costs. We suggest a hybrid genetic algorithm with our blank job insertion algorithm and demonstrate its performance in simulation experiments.",

Unused potential for increasing energy efficiency can be found by optimizing the production schedule.

	abstract = "Synchronization of workers and vehicles plays a major role in many industries such as logistics, healthcare or airport ground handling. In this paper, we focus on operational ground handling planning and model it as an archetype of vehicle routing problems with multiple synchronization constraints, coined as “abstract vehicle routing problem with worker and vehicle synchronization” (AVRPWVS). The AVRPWVS deals with routing workers to ground handling jobs such as unloading baggage or refuelling an aircraft, while meeting each job’s time window. Moreover, each job can be performed by a variable number of workers. As airports span vast distances and due to security regulations, workers use vehicles to travel between locations. Furthermore, each vehicle, moved by a driver, can carry several workers. We propose two mathematical multi-commodity flow formulations based on time-space networks to efficiently model five synchronization types including movement and load synchronization. Moreover, we develop a branch-and-price heuristic that employs both conventional variable branching and a novel variable fixing strategy. We demonstrate that the procedure achieves results close to the optimal solution in short time when compared to the two integer models."

The contribution of the paper is threefold: (i) It presents a classification of different types of synchronization. (ii) It discusses the central issues related to the exact and heuristic solution of such problems. (iii) It comprehensively reviews pertinent literature with respect to applications as well as successful solution approaches, and it identifies promising algorithmic avenues.},

One of the mechanisms used to save energy is the shut-down mechanism which puts the system into a sleep state when it is idle. No energy is consumed in this state, but a fixed amount of energy is required for a transition from the sleep state to the active state which is equal to L times the energy required for the execution of a unit-time task. In this paper, we focus on the off-line version of this problem where a set of unit-time tasks with release dates and deadlines have to be scheduled in order to minimize the overall consumed energy during the idle periods of the schedule. Here we focus on the case where the tasks have agreeable deadlines. For the single processor case, an O(n3) algorithm has been proposed in Gururaj et al. (2010) for unit-time tasks and arbitrary L. We improve this result by introducing a new O(n2) polynomial-time algorithm for tasks with arbitrary processing times and arbitrary L. For the multiprocessor case we also improve the complexity from O(n3m2) Gururaj et al. (2010) to O(n2m) in the case of unit-time tasks and unit L."

The anchorage level is the number of individual decisions with the same value in the solutions of the baseline and the real instances. We consider the case of CPM-scheduling with simple precedence constraints when the job durations of the real instance may be different than those of the baseline instance. We show that, given a solution of the baseline instance, computing a reactive solution of the real instance with a maximum anchorage level is a polynomial problem. This maximum level is called the anchorage strength of the baseline solution with respect to the real instance. We also prove that this latter problem becomes NP-hard when the real schedule must satisfy time windows constraints. We finally consider the problem of finding a proactive solution of the baseline instance whose guaranteed anchorage strength is maximum with respect to a subset of real instances. When each real duration belongs to a known uncertainty interval, we show that such a proactive solution (possibly with a deadline constraint) can be polynomially computed.},

	abstract = { The inventory routing problem (IRP) and the production routing problem (PRP) are two difficult problems arising in the planning of integrated supply chains. These problems are solved in an attempt to jointly optimize production, inventory, distribution, and routing decisions. Although several studies have proposed exact algorithms to solve the single-vehicle problems, the multivehicle aspect is often neglected because of its complexity. We introduce multivehicle PRP and IRP formulations, with and without a vehicle index, to solve the problems under both the maximum level (ML) and order-up-to level (OU) inventory replenishment policies. The vehicle index formulations are further improved using symmetry breaking constraints; the nonvehicle index formulations are strengthened by several cuts. A heuristic based on an adaptive large neighborhood search technique is also developed to determine initial solutions, and branch-and-cut algorithms are proposed to solve the different formulations. The results show that the vehicle index formulations are superior in finding optimal solutions, whereas the nonvehicle index formulations are generally better at providing good lower bounds on larger instances. IRP and PRP instances with up to 35 customers, three periods, and three vehicles can be solved to optimality within two hours for the ML policy. By using parallel computing, the algorithms could solve the instances for the same policy with up to 45 and 50 customers, three periods, and three vehicles for the IRP and PRP, respectively. For the more difficult IRP (PRP) under the OU policy, the algorithms could handle instances with up to 30 customers, three (six) periods, and three vehicles on a single core machine, and up to 45 (35) customers, three (six) periods, and three vehicles on a multicore machine. }

We consider the variant with a single item, a single supplier, multiple vehicles, and a finite multiperiod planning horizon, minimizing the sum of inventory and travel costs. In addition, we address an alternative objective function that minimizes the logistic ratio, defined as the total travel cost divided by the total quantity delivered to customers. This second objective function, while more realistic in some logistics settings, poses a challenge for integer programming models and exact methods because of its nonlinearity. To our knowledge, no heuristic method has been proposed to address this objective in the IRP variant addressed in this paper. To solve this problem with each of these objective functions, we propose effective metaheuristic algorithms based on iterated local search and simulated annealing. Computational experiments show that these algorithms provide reasonably high-quality solutions in relatively short running times for both objective functions when compared to other methods for well-known instances from the literature. Moreover, the algorithms produce new best solutions for some of these instances.},

The goal is to minimize the total cost of the distribution that comprises the inventory cost at the supplier and at the customers and the routing cost. We present a matheuristic that combines a tabu search and mathematical programming formulations. When compared with two exact methods on 640 small instances, the matheuristic finds 192 (48\%) optima over the 402 instances with known optima and improves 125 upper bounds. Tested on 240 large instances (with up to 200 customers) for which no optimal solutions are known, it improves the best solution for 220 (92\%) of the 240 instances.

	abstract = { While the joint optimization of production and outbound distribution decisions in a manufacturing context have been intensively studied in the past decade, the integration of production, inventory, and inbound transportation from suppliers have received much less attention despite its practical relevance. This paper aims to fill the gap by introducing a general model for the assembly routing problem (ARP), which consists of simultaneously planning the assembly of a finished product at a plant and the routing of vehicles collecting materials from suppliers to meet the inventory requirements imposed by the production. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program and we propose a three-phase decomposition matheuristic that relies on the iterative solution of different subproblems. The first phase determines a setup schedule while the second phase optimizes production quantities, supplier visit schedules and shipment quantities. The third phase solves a vehicle routing problem for each period in the planning horizon. The algorithm is flexible, and we show how it can also be used to solve two well-known outbound distribution problems related to the ARP: the production routing problem and the inventory routing problem. Using the same parameter setting for all problems and instances, we obtain 781 new best-known solutions out of 2,628 standard IRP and PRP test instances. In particular, on large-scale multivehicle instances, the new algorithm outperforms specialized state-of-the-art heuristics for these two problems.

The shortest routes between any two points in the system are given and a demand for one or several products is specified for a number of stations within the distribution system. It is desired to find a way to assign stations to trucks in such a manner that station demands are satisfied and total mileage covered by the fleet is a minimum A procedure based on a linear programming formulation is given for obtaining a near optimal solution. The calculations may be readily performed by hand or by an automatic digital computing machine. No practical applications of the method have been made as yet. A number of trial problems have been calculated, however. }

To account for the variability associated with the quantities requested by customers, it is assumed that the demands are fuzzy numbers simulated by a time-dependent algorithm. Moreover, the vehicle fleet and distribution centres are considered with a defined capacity. The credibility theory of fuzzy sets is used to implement a multi-objective fuzzy chance-constrained programming model, where the total costs and carbon emissions are minimised. The resolution of the 3E-FGVRP is conducted by using a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm. The multiple-criteria decision-making ELECTRE III method is applied to select the best solutions belonging to each Pareto front. Finally, the validity of the model is demonstrated by performing an optimisation procedure with three different initial random sets of populations. The application of the model to a case study of the Sicilian agri-food context confirms the robustness of the model, and the optimal configurations of the three-echelon supply chain can be found."

	All over the world, huge numbers of perishable goods are transported from suppliers to recipients every day. Some perishable products such as foods and medicine require a special treatment during delivery due to their limited lifetime, and all perishable products must be transported as quickly as possible before they spoil. In addition to the time limitation on transport, high frequency of transportation may lead to high transportation cost, making the optimization of transportation cost for delivering perishable products very important in this industry. In addition, high frequency of transportation may also contribute to air pollution. In order to address this problem, this study proposes a green vehicle routing problem (VRP) for perishable products which optimizes the operational cost, deterioration cost, carbon emissions and customer satisfaction. The proposed VRP model also considers time windows, different travelling time during peak hour and off-peak hour, and working hours. This paper solves the proposed model using a many-objective gradient evolution (MOGE) algorithm. GE algorithm is a new metaheuristic which was originally proposed for continuous problems with a single objective. However, this study improves the original GE algorithm with discretization, non-dominated sorting, and crowding distance approaches. The proposed model and algorithm are employed to solve a fruit distribution problem. The experiment results show that the proposed MOGE algorithm has more promising results than other algorithms."

This problem and its numerous expansions are one of the most important and most applicable transportation and logistics problems. In this study, the green vehicle routing and scheduling problem with heterogeneous fleet including reverse logistics in the form of collecting returned goods along with weighted earliness and tardiness costs is studied to establish a trade-off between operational and environmental costs and to minimize both simultaneously. In this regard, a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model is proposed. Since the problem is categorized as NP-hard, two meta-heuristics, a simulated annealing (SA) and a genetic algorithm (GA) are suggested in order to find near-optimal solutions for large instances in a reasonable computational time. The performances of the proposed algorithms are evaluated in comparison with the mathematical model for small-sized problems and with each other for problems of all size using a set of defined test problems. Analysis of the results considering two criteria: solutions quality and computational times, indicates the satisfactory performance of the presented algorithms in a proper computational time. Meanwhile, a statistical hypothesis testing (T-test) is conducted. It can generally be observed that SA achieves relatively better results in terms of solution quality, while GA spends less computational time for all-sized test problems. Eventually, sensitivity analysis is conducted to investigate the effect of collecting returned goods on the cost of total CO2 emissions, variable costs of the fleet and the objective function value."

For the solution of more realistic-sized problem instances, a General Variable Neighborhood Search (GVNS)-based framework is adopted. Novel adaptive shaking methods are proposed as intelligent components of the developed GVNS algorithms to further improve their performance. To evaluate the proposed GVNS schemes, several problem instances are randomly generated by following specific instructions from the literature and adopting real vehicles’ parameters. Comparisons between these solutions and the corresponding ones achieved by CPLEX are made. The computational results indicate the efficiency of the proposed GVNS-based algorithms, with the best GVNS scheme to produce 7% better solutions than CPLEX for small problems. Finally, the economic and environmental impacts of using either homogeneous or heterogeneous fleet of vehicles are examined."

First, we developed an ε-accurate inner polyhedral approximation method for the nonlinear relation between the travel time and travel speed. The approximation error was controlled within the limit of a given parameter ε, which could be as low as 0.01% in our experiments. Second, we developed two ε-accurate methods for the nonlinear fuel consumption rate (FCR) function of a fossil fuel-powered vehicle while ensuring the approximation error to be within the same parameter ε. Based on these linearization methods, we proposed an ε-accurate mathematical linear programming model for the continuous PRP (ε-CPRP for short), in which decision variables such as driving speeds, travel times, arrival/departure/waiting times, vehicle loads, and FCRs were all optimized concurrently on their continuous domains. A theoretical analysis is provided to confirm that the solutions of ε-CPRP are feasible and controlled within the predefined limit. The proposed ε-CPRP model is rigorously tested on well-known benchmark PRP instances in the literature, and has solved PRP instances optimally with up to 25 customers within reasonable CPU times. New optimal solutions of many PRP instances were reported for the first time in the experiments."

An interactive solution approach integrating a fuzzy logic controlled particle swarm optimization and a modified adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic is designed to search for solutions for the carbon pricing initiatives-based bi-level pollution routing problem. Computational experiments and analysis are then conducted to shed light on the influence of carbon pricing initiatives on carbon emissions and the total cost of freight companies. In this part, extended models for the carbon pricing initiatives-based bi-level pollution routing problem with a freight company delivering to multiple regions and with multiple freight companies are proposed and computed using the algorithms based on the interactive solution approach.

Moreover, transportation route planning, controlling the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and customer satisfaction constitute the major parts of the supply chain that need to be taken into account integratedly within a common framework. For this purpose, this paper tries to introduce the reliable Pollution-Routing Problem with Cross-dock Selection (PRP-CDS) where the products are processed and transported through at least one cross-dock. To formulate the problem, a Bi-Objective Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (BOMILP) model is developed, where the first objective is to minimize total cost including pollution and routing costs and the second is to maximize supply reliability. Accordingly, sustainable development of the supply chain is addressed. Due to the high complexity of the problem, two well-known meta-heuristic algorithms including Multi-Objective Simulated-annealing Algorithm (MOSA) and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) are designed to provide efficient Pareto solutions. Furthermore, the ε-constraint method is applied to the model to test its applicability in small-sized problems. The efficiency of the suggested solution techniques is evaluated using different measures and a statistical test. To validate the performance of the proposed methodology, a real case study problem is conducted using the sensitivity analysis of demand parameter. Based on the main findings of the study, it is concluded that the solution techniques can yield high-quality solutions and NSGA-II is considered as the most efficient solution tool, the optimal route planning of the case study problem in delivery and pick-up phases is attained using the best-found Pareto solution and the highest change in the objective function occurs for the total cost value by applying a 20% increase in the demand parameter."

We propose an integer linear programming (ILP) model to formulate the TDEVRP and show that the state-of-the-art commercial optimizer (CPLEX) can only solve instances of very limited sizes (with no more than 15 customers). We thus propose an iterated variable neighbourhood search (IVNS) algorithm to find near-optimal solutions for larger instances. The key ingredients of IVNS include a fast evaluation method that allows local search moves to be evaluated in constant time O(1), a variable neighbourhood descent (VND) procedure to optimize the node sequences, and a departure time and speed optimization procedure(DSOP) to optimize the speed and departure time on each arc of the routes. The proposed algorithm demonstrates excellent performances on a set of newly created instances. In particular, it can achieve optimal or near-optimal solutions for all small-size instances (with no more than 15 customers) and is robust for large-size instances where the gap between the average and the best solution value is consistently lower than 2.38%. Additional experimental results on 40 benchmark instances of the closely related Time-Dependent Pollution Routing Problem indicate that the proposed IVNS algorithm also performs very well and even discovers 39 new best-known solutions (improved upper bounds)."

A bi-level mathematical model is proposed to derive optimal design considering the equilibrium of route choice and waiting time for charging. The objective is to minimize the joint cost of facility constructions and EV drivers’ travel and waiting time over the network. The upper-level model allocates the facilities and their capacity, while the lower-level model characterizes equilibrium behavior of drivers’ route and charging facility choices. In particular, we model drivers at each charging facility as the M(t)/M/n queue and approximate the average queuing time and probability of waiting time as functions of facility capacity and demand arrival rate. The bi-level model is then converted into a single-level model, and the solution algorithm is proposed for iteratively solving the relaxed problems. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on three networks to evaluate algorithm performances, assess solution robustness and understand the scalability of the solution approach on large networks."

The rapid proliferation of EVs will introduce an unprecedented load on the existing electric grid due to the charging/discharging behavior of the EVs, thus motivating the need for novel approaches for routing EVs across the grid. In this paper, a novel distributed control framework based on noncooperative game theory for routing of EVs within the smart grid is proposed. The goal of this framework is to control and balance the electricity load in a distributed manner across the grid while taking into account the traffic congestion and the waiting time at charging stations. The EV routing problem is formulated as a repeated game, and it is shown that the selfish behavior of EVs will result in a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium with the price of anarchy upper bounded by the ratio of the variance of the ground load to the total number of EVs in the grid. In particular, it is shown that any achieved Nash equilibrium substantially improves the load balance across the grid. Moreover, the results are extended to capture the stochastic nature of induced ground load as well as the subjective behavior of the EV owners using the behavioral framework of prospect theory. Simulation results provide new insights on efficient energy pricing at charging stations and under realistic grid conditions."

For this emerging business paradigm, the scheduling optimization considering interdependent scenarios and constraints becomes the key issue. In addition, telecommuting jobs are becoming increasingly popular with the support of highly developed telecommunication technologies. This paper develops a framework for optimal scheduling of an electric vehicle owner, who seeks to share the vehicle in a cost-effective manner while ensure sufficient working hours on a telecommuting job at home. The electric vehicle owner aims at minimizing delivery times of customers and charging cost simultaneously, considering a time-of-use charging pricing mechanism, while satisfying customers demands and working hour requirements. To describe this optimal scheduling problem, this paper firstly introduces three elements: state, action and task. Specifically, three states are involved, including charging state, parking state and transporting state. Further, actions of electric vehicle owner are used as the links for state transitions. Finally, multiple tasks are completed sequentially in a multi-temporal time horizon, where each task is assigned with a selected state. The proposed model formulates the scheduling problem for each state. Moreover, supplementary constraints representing state transitions, working hour requirement and energy neutral position of an electric vehicle battery are further incorporated to establish the optimal scheduling model for the entire process. This paper presents the first-of-its-kind work incorporating all the vital aspects of a well-defined optimal scheduling problem, in which an electric vehicle owner seeks car-sharing opportunity and conducts a telecommuting job at home, considering multiple states, actions and tasks in a continuous multi-temporal horizon. The numerical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed framework in terms of optimizing routing selections and charging time allocation. The performance of the proposed model is also compared with baseline scenarios, and it finds that up to 18.5% cost saving can be accomplished by adopting the proposed model, which validates its cost benefits."

We propose five new operators for ALNS which are tested on 120 instances each of E-VRP-NL and E-VRP-NL-LD, and 80 instances of E-VRP-NL-LD-CCS.

Most studies have focused on the electric vehicle routing problem under a deterministic environment, neglecting the effects of uncertain factors in practical logistics distribution. Thus, a novel fuzzy electric vehicle routing problem with time windows and recharging stations (FEVRPTW) is investigated in this study, and a fuzzy optimization model is established based on credibility theory for this problem. In the presented model, fuzzy numbers are used to denote the uncertainties of service time, battery energy consumption, and travel time. Moreover, the partial recharge is allowed under the uncertain environment. To solve the model, an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm enhanced with the fuzzy simulation method is proposed. In the proposed ALNS algorithm, four new removal algorithms are designed and integrated for addressing the FEVRPTW. To further improve the algorithmic performance, the variable neighborhood descent algorithm is embedded into the proposed ALNS algorithm and five local search operators are applied. The experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed ALNS algorithm for solving the presented model."

The makespan estimation algorithm is tested on the well-known PSPLIB benchmark library where the best known lower bounds are improved for 5 instances.

	abstract = "The learning effects of the workers and machine deterioration in an aggregate production planning (APP) problem have not been taken into account in the literature yet. These factors affect the performance of any real-world production system and require attention. In this paper, a bi-objective optimization model is developed for an APP problem with labor learning effect and machine deterioration. The first objective of this model maximizes the profit by improving learning and reducing the failure cost of the system. The second objective function minimizes the costs associated with repairs and deterioration, which depend on the failure rate of the machines in the production periods. The aim of this article is to obtain appropriate levels of production rates in regular and overtimes, inventory and shortage levels, workers' hiring and firing levels, and the quantities of the products that are subcontracted. To demonstrate the validity of the proposed mathematical formulation, the multi-objective model is converted into a single-objective model using the fuzzy goal programming method, based on which computational experiments are performed on a set of random small-sized instances solved by the LINGO software. As the problem is shown NP-hard, a subpopulation genetic algorithm (SPGA) is proposed to solve large-size problems. In addition, two other meta-heuristics called weighted sum multi-objective genetic algorithm (WMOGA) and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) are utilized to solve a set of benchmark problems, in order to validate the results obtained and to assess the performance of the SPGA. For tuning the parameters, the Taguchi method is proposed in order to obtain high-quality solutions. Finally, the performances of the proposed algorithms are statistically compared together. The computational results show that SPGA compared to the other algorithms has a better performance in terms of some multi-objective optimization criteria."

In this paper, we investigate a production planning problem in a steel production process considering the energy consumption cost which is a nonlinear function of the production quantity. Due to the uncertain environment, the production demands are stochastic. Taking a scenario-based approach to express the stochastic demands according to the knowledge of planners on the demand distributions, we formulate the stochastic production planning problem as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model. Approximated with the piecewise linear functions, the MINLP model is transformed into a mixed integer linear programming model. The approximation error can be improved by adjusting the linearization ranges repeatedly. Based on the piecewise linearization, a stepwise Lagrangian relaxation (SLR) heuristic for the problem is proposed where variable splitting is introduced during Lagrangian relaxation (LR). After decomposition, one subproblem is solved by linear programming and the other is solved by an effective polynomial time algorithm. The SLR heuristic is tested on a large set of problem instances and the results show that the algorithm generates solutions very close to optimums in an acceptable time. The impact of demand uncertainty on the solution is studied by a computational discussion on scenario generation."

In the proposed problem, demands and costs are uncertain and assumed to be fuzzy variables with known possibility distributions. The objective of the problem is to minimize the total expected cost, including the expected value of the sum of the inventory holding and production cost in the planning horizon. Because the proposed problem is too complex to apply conventional optimization algorithms, we suggest an approximation approach (AA) to evaluate the objective function. After that, two algorithms are designed to solve the proposed production planning problem. The first is a PSO algorithm combining the AA, and the second is a hybrid PSO algorithm integrating the AA, neural network (NN) and PSO. Finally, one numerical example is provided to compare the effectiveness of the proposed two algorithms."

In this cases, optimization of a solely scalar function of profit is not sufficient to control the risk. We apply Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) measure to model the risk preferences of the producer. The producer is interested in shaping the risk by bounding from below the means of α-tail distributions of profit for different values of α. The resulting model is nonconvex.

The supply part is concerned with the collection of raw materials from geographically dispersed suppliers, while the production planning part addresses the conversion of those raw materials into final products to satisfy customer demand. The proposed model is an extension of the model introduced by Kuhn and Liske (2011) considering dynamic demand and general structures of the bill of materials. We investigate two scenarios: one including raw material inventories at the production site, and the other supposing just-in-time (JIT) supply. Numerical experiments show that substantial cost savings are possible with an integrated planning approach compared to a classical sequential approach. The JIT scenario and situations with a rather low utilization in the production system benefit most from the integration. The proposed supply vehicle routing and production planning problem has a reverse structure unlike the well-studied production-distribution systems. Surprisingly, a sensitivity analysis on the dependency of the cost savings on different parameters show a quite similar behavior for both types of planning problems."

Because of the machine failure rate, the total production output depends on the combination of loads assigned to different machines. We consider the integration of load distribution decisions with production planning decision. The product demands are considered to be known in advance. The objective is to minimize the sum of holding costs, backorder costs, production costs, setup costs, capacity change costs and unused capacity costs while satisfying the demand over specified time horizon. The constraint is not to exceed available repair resources required to repair the machine breakdown.

According to the credibility service levels set by customers in advance, the manufacturer has to satisfy different product demands. In the proposed production problem, production cost, inventory cost and product demands are uncertain and characterized by fuzzy variables. The problem is to determine when and how many products are manufactured so as to maximize the credibility of the fuzzy costs not exceeding a given allowable invested capital, and this credibility can be regarded as the investment risk criteria in fuzzy decision systems. In the case when the fuzzy parameters are mutually independent gamma distributions, we can turn the service level constraints into their equivalent deterministic forms. However, in this situation the exact analytical expression for the credibility objective is unavailable, thus conventional optimization algorithms cannot be used to solve our production planning problems. To overcome this obstacle, we adopt an approximation scheme to compute the credibility objective, and deal with the convergence about the computational method. Furthermore, we develop two heuristic solution methods. The first is a combination of the approximation method and a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, and the second is a hybrid algorithm by integrating the approximation method, a neural network (NN), and the PSO algorithm. Finally, we consider one 6-product source, 6-period production planning problem, and compare the effectiveness of two algorithms via numerical experiments."

In this study, we propose a multi-objective model to optimize the production quantity, where the clinical trial duration and the total production and operational costs are minimized. The problem is formulated as a multi-stage stochastic programming model to capture the dynamic inventory allocation process in the supply chains.

In the model, the DCF problem optimizes reconfiguration of machine cells, with varying production quantities in different periods determined by the HPP model. The HPP problem, formulated as an integrated model, determines the optimal production plans that meet forecast demands in the planning horizon, with capacity limitations of the machine cells formed through the DCF model. Compared with prior studies that integrate DCF and production planning (PP) problems, this paper provides the most comprehensive options needed to meet demands in dynamic cellular manufacturing systems (DCMS). With the introduction of HPP, the model could incorporate more decision variables such as inventory, internal production, subcontracting and backlogging costs, inter- and intra-cell material handling costs, yet with less solution complexity. The model is solved with branch-and-bound method, and its complexity and solution results are analyzed using empirical data from a mold manufacturing plant, with the results of the model compared with those in the literature. Our analyses show that the proposed model is simpler and easier to solve, and that the total cost is insensitive to demand volatility and decreases inversely with the number of cells."

abstract = {The amount of pollution emitted by a vehicle depends on its load and speed, among other factors. This paper presents the Pollution-Routing Problem (PRP), an extension of the classical Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with a broader and more comprehensive objective function that accounts not just for the travel distance, but also for the amount of greenhouse emissions, fuel, travel times and their costs. Mathematical models are described for the PRP with or without time windows and computational experiments are performed on realistic instances. The paper sheds light on the tradeoffs between various parameters such as vehicle load, speed and total cost, and offers insight on economies of ‘environmental-friendly’ vehicle routing. The results suggest that, contrary to the VRP, the PRP is significantly more difficult to solve to optimality but has the potential of yielding savings in total cost.}

  abstract={The Time-Dependent Pollution-Routing Problem (TDPRP) consists of routing a fleet of vehicles in order to serve a set of customers and determining the speeds on each leg of the routes. The cost function includes emissions and driver costs, taking into account traffic congestion which, at peak periods, significantly restricts vehicle speeds and increases emissions. We describe an integer linear programming formulation of the TDPRP and provide illustrative examples to motivate the problem and give insights about the tradeoffs it involves. We also provide an analytical characterization of the optimal solutions for a single-arc version of the problem, identifying conditions under which it is optimal to wait idly at certain locations in order to avoid congestion and to reduce the cost of emissions. Building on these analytical results we describe a novel departure time and speed optimization algorithm for the cases when the route is fixed. Finally, using benchmark instances, we present results on the computational performance of the proposed formulation and on the speed optimization procedure.},

title = "The fleet size and mix pollution-routing problem",
abstract = "This paper introduces the fleet size and mix pollution-routing problem which extends the pollution-routing problem by considering a heterogeneous vehicle fleet. The main objective is to minimize the sum of vehicle fixed costs and routing cost, where the latter can be defined with respect to the cost of fuel and CO2 emissions, and driver cost. Solving this problem poses several methodological challenges. To this end, we have developed a powerful metaheuristic which was successfully applied to a large pool of realistic benchmark instances. Several analyses were conducted to shed light on the trade-offs between various performance indicators, including capacity utilization, fuel and emissions and costs pertaining to vehicle acquisition, fuel consumption and drivers. The analyses also quantify the benefits of using a heterogeneous fleet over a homogeneous one.",

abstract = {Little has been done in the study of these intriguing questions, and I do not wish to give the impression that any extensive set of ideas exists that could be called a "theory." What is quite surprising, as far as the histories of science and philosophy are concerned, is that the major impetus for the fantastic growth of interest in brain processes, both psychological and physiological, has come from a device, a machine, the digital computer. In dealing with a human being and a human society, we enjoy the luxury of being irrational, illogical, inconsistent, and incomplete, and yet of coping. In operating a computer, we must meet the rigorous requirements for detailed instructions and absolute precision. If we understood the ability of the human mind to make effective decisions when confronted by complexity, uncertainty, and irrationality, then we could use computers a million times more effectively than we do. Recognition of this fact has been a motivation for the spurt of research in the field of neurophysiology. The more we study the information-processing aspects of the mind, the more perplexed and impressed we become. It will be a very long time before we understand these processes sufficiently to reproduce them. In any case, the mathematician sees hundreds and thousands of formidable new problems in dozens of blossoming areas, puzzles galore, and challenges to his heart's content. He may never resolve some of these, but he will never be bored. What more can he ask?}}
